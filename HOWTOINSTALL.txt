1. sudo npm install -g npx
2. npx create-reat-app burger_builder # burger_builder - name of project and also reacts dir with the name

3. to start app on not defalt port (default port: 3000)
In package.json:
"start": "PORT=3006 react-scripts star"
or (may be) more general solution by @IsaacPak
"start": "export PORT=3006 react-scripts start


Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  yarn start
    Starts the development server.

  yarn build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  yarn test
    Starts the test runner.

  yarn eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd burger_builder
  yarn start
